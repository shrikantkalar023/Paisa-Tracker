# Paisa-Tracker

Introducing [**Paisa Tracker**](https://paisa-tracker.vercel.app/): Simplify Expense Tracking

## What's this?

This is a project I made as a front-end software engineer to track my expenses.

## What tech I used to make this?

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) : React Framework of my choice
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) : ORM which integrates well with tRPC
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) : Best CSS solution out there
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) : Typesafe backend
- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev): Auth Provider

These technologies are part of T3 Stack.
